Project Title: Public transportation efficiency analysis 

Phase 1: Project Definition and Design Thinking

Project Definition: The Transport System of the Recife Metropolitan Area is under change. As asubsidy  to  its  change  an   efficiency  analysis  is   done  with   the   purpose  of  highlightingcharacteristics of the efficient systems. Twelve transport system from several countries inEurope and seven from Brazil are analyzed: nine from Europe and only one from Brazilwere found efficient. These system are characterized by very different power structure andtariff   structure.   Efficient   ones   adopted   a   more   democratic   power   partition   amongcommunalities and established a more broad system of tariffs. Among other lessons it issuggested that  RMR adopts a structure that allows a more equal partition of the severalmunicipalities comprising the Metro Area   including  representatives of users groups likeworkers associations and syndicates.  Also it should  adopt  a more flexible tariff systemsgiving advantages to usual users at the same time that decreases costs and improves theoperational efficiency.

Design Thinking:

1.	Project Objectives: Design thinking has revolutionised the way we approach problem-solving and innovation.

2.	Analysis Approach:The first stage of any design thinking process involves designers seeking to understand and empathise with the needs of the users by conducting research, interviewing users and gathering data to gain insights into the users’ needs, challenges and behaviours.

3.	Visualization Selection: all interviewees used at least one app to help them plan their journey (Google Maps, Apple Maps, CityMapper or Moovit), though limitations were mentioned for every single one.
